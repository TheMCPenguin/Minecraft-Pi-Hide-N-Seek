To use, you will need an already up-and-running multiplayer working on the "Hide N Seek" map.
Let any other players spawn in before running the Hide N Seek script.
Choose how many players are playing by typing in a single number (1-8) and pressing enter.
You should all spawn on a different spoke of the central circle. You may now do what you like, 
except flying and building (world is immutable). 
The next bit of code is untested, as I cannot get multiplayer on my Pi. 
If you see another player, go up and quickly right-click their legs. 
If the code works then the player will be teleported to a cage in the sky. 
That leaves the other players to fight it out. 
The last person standing outside of a cage is the winner, and the winner may gloat as much as they like!
Side note: You may want to add code that allows you to post these instructions, 
mainly the gloating bit, to the Minecraft chat. XD
